                    When you start to get an understanding of your emotional difficulties, CBT encourages you to break down a specific problem you have using the ABC format, in which:
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Adversity or activating event.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Your beliefs about the event. It involves both obvious and underlying thoughts about situations, yourself, and others.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Consequences, which includes your behavioral or emotional response.</li>
                </p>
